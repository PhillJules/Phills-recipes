    with a harmonious blend of textures and a perfect balance of sweet and

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Succulent Beef Strips: Thinly sliced strips of beef,
      typically sirloin or flank, serve as the protein powerhouse of this
      dish, delivering meaty goodness.
    </li>
    <li>
      Crispy Coating: A light yet crispy coating is achieved by dusting the
      beef with cornstarch, creating a delightful crunch when fried.
    </li>
    <li>
      Chili Sauce: The star of the show, the chili sauce, is a symphony of
      flavors. It balances the sweet notes of
      sugar with the fiery kick of red chilies, creating a sauce
      that's both bold and memorable.
    </li>
    <li>
      Aromatic Vegetables: Sliced bell peppers, onions, and scallions not
      only add vibrant color but also a fresh and crunchy
      contrast to the tender beef.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sesame Seeds and Fresh Herbs: A sprinkle of sesame seeds and
      chopped fresh cilantro or parsley adds a final
      touch of elegance and fragrance to the dish.
    </li>
