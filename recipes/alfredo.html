        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Cooking the Fettuccine: The journey begins with cooking the fettuccine
            noodles to perfection al dente and ready to absorb
            the creamy Alfredo sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chicken Perfection: Tender pieces of chicken are seasoned
            and cooked until they attain a delicious golden-brown exterior
            and remain juicy on the inside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blanching the Broccoli: Fresh broccoli florets are briefly
            blanched to retain their vibrant color and crisp texture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Creating the Alfredo Sauce: The creamy Alfredo sauce is crafted by gently
            simmering heavy cream, butter, garlic, and Parmesan cheese
            until they meld into a velvety, luscious consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combining the Elements: The cooked fettuccine noodles, succulent chicken
            pieces, blanched broccoli florets, and the creamy Alfredo sauce are
            lovingly combined, creating a harmonious pasta symphony.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seasoning and Garnishing: A touch of black pepper, a pinch of salt,
            and perhaps a dash of nutmeg are added for seasoning.
            A final flourish of grated Parmesan cheese on top adds
            an extra layer of decadence and visual appeal.
