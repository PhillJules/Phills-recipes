      <h2>Steps:</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Marinate the steak. Mix mirin, soy sauce, sugar, and Doubanjiang or chilli
          oil in a bowl, add the steak pieces, and leave to marinade for 30 minutes or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the mushrooms, spinach and steak: Place a pan on a medium to high heat,
          add oil and fry the mushrooms for a few minutes until brown, and set aside.
          Toss in the spinach and fry for a few minutes until wilted.
          Then add the steak pieces and fry until brown and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the tare: Add a little more oil to the pot and fry the garlic,
          scallions/spring onions and ginger for a minute or two until fragrant.
          Then stir in the miso paste, tahini, sesame oil, soy sauce, Doubanjiang
          or chilli oil and sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the broth: Pour in the beef stock and leave to simmer with the lid
          on for 10 minutes. Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the Ramen noodles: Put them on a few minutes before you plan
          to assemble the ramen. Don't salt the water as you would for pasta, leave it
          in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, but don't let them get soft, then drain
          and rinse under cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assemble: Add a portion of noodles to each bowl, pour on the broth and top
          each bowl with beef, mushrooms, spinach,
          ramen eggs, sesame seeds, and the green parts of the scallions/spring onions.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
